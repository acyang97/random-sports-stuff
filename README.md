## Random Sports Stuff

Just an app for me to learn new stuff while continuing to hunt for a job. I decided to play around more data from sports since I'm a sports addict. Below are some logs of what I did. I'm hoping to learn something new and get something done with it once or twice a week at least. Lets see how long this can last lmao.

8 June 2022:

- Built a page where I can select football players and compare their stats such as goals scored, assists, shots on target, etc
- Data was scrapped using Selenium, learning how to scrap data was something new to me
- Learnt and used D3 for data visualization.
